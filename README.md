HOmeAutomation daemon 

Written some time ago, I used this daemon to control my home 
AV Receiver from denon via serial console from FreeBSD host.
It supports the Griffin PowerMate as volume control mute/unmute,
Logitech UltraX univrsal remote control, and also can control mplayer via socket.

A dead project, but someone might find something interesting here, like
the ultrax scan code map...
